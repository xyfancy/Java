/****************** Ex2*****************
* Follow the HelloDate.java example in this chapter to create a "hello, world" progam that simply dispalys that statement. 
* You need only a single method in your class (the "main" one that executes when the program starts). 
* Remember to make it static and to include the argument list (even though you don't use it).
* Compile the program with javac and run it using java. If you are using a different development environment than the JDK,
* learn how to compile and run programs in that environment.
